# Deque Data Structure in JavaScript ðŸš€  

A simple implementation of the **Deque** (Double-Ended Queue) data structure in JavaScript. This repository demonstrates how to create a deque class with essential methods and explains its functionality with practical examples.  

---

## What is a Deque?  
A **Deque** (Double-Ended Queue) is a linear data structure that allows elements to be added or removed from both endsâ€”front and back. It is a generalization of a queue, where elements can be inserted or removed from either end, making it more versatile than a standard queue.  

---

## Features  
- **InsertFront**: Add an element to the front of the deque.  
- **InsertBack**: Add an element to the back of the deque.  
- **RemoveFront**: Remove and return the element from the front.  
- **RemoveBack**: Remove and return the element from the back.  
- **PeekFront**: View the element at the front without removing it.  
- **PeekBack**: View the element at the back without removing it.  
- **Size**: Get the number of elements in the deque.  
- **isEmpty**: Check if the deque is empty.

## Code Implementation  

Hereâ€™s the JavaScript implementation of the deque:  

```javascript
class Deque {
    constructor() {
        this.items = [];
    }

    // Add an element to the front of the deque
    insertFront(element) {
        this.items.unshift(element);
    }

    // Add an element to the back of the deque
    insertBack(element) {
        this.items.push(element);
    }

    // Remove and return the element from the front of the deque
    removeFront() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return "Deque is empty!";
        }
        return this.items.shift();
    }

    // Remove and return the element from the back of the deque
    removeBack() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return "Deque is empty!";
        }
        return this.items.pop();
    }

    // Peek at the element at the front without removing it
    peekFront() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return "Deque is empty!";
        }
        return this.items[0];
    }

    // Peek at the element at the back without removing it
    peekBack() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return "Deque is empty!";
        }
        return this.items[this.items.length - 1];
    }

    // Get the size of the deque
    size() {
        return this.items.length;
    }

    // Check if the deque is empty
    isEmpty() {
        return this.items.length === 0;
    }
}
```

## Example Usage  

```javascript
// Initialize the deque
const deque = new Deque();

// Insert elements at the front and back
deque.insertFront(10);
deque.insertBack(20);
deque.insertFront(5);

// Peek at the front and back elements
console.log(deque.peekFront()); // Output: 5
console.log(deque.peekBack());  // Output: 20

// Remove elements from the front and back
console.log(deque.removeFront()); // Output: 5
console.log(deque.removeBack());  // Output: 20

// Get the size of the deque
console.log(deque.size()); // Output: 1

// Check if the deque is empty
console.log(deque.isEmpty()); // Output: false
```

## Real-World Applications  
1. **Task Scheduling**: Used in round-robin scheduling for managing tasks.  
2. **Sliding Window Algorithms**: Efficiently processing a range of elements in an array or list.  
3. **Palindrome Checker**: Checking if a string is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends.  
4. **Deque-based Buffer**: Implementing a buffer where data can be inserted and removed from both ends.
